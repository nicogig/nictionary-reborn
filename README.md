# nictionary-reborn
The iconic BARB dictionary. Now in SwiftUI.

## What is this?

Back in the Pink Friday era, Nicki Minaj released an app (My Pink Friday) to promote the album and tour. Being an early 2010s creation, the app relied heavily on Social Media, and is long gone. This is a recreation of the "Nictionary", a section of the app with lingo used by Nicki Minaj fans.

## Why?

Because nostalgia, because the early 2010s were fun, and because I find some of the quotes ridiculously funny and want them on my iPhone 13.

## How?

Everything is done in SwiftUI. The recordings and textures are extracted from the original app, whose Android version liberally circulates online.

## Final Thoughts

Credit goes to the original authors of the app, and to Nicki Minaj herself for the voice recordings (and the idea of Nictionary). The work I have done here is an homage to the era and the app, and in no way wants to take ownership of either the concept or execution of Nictionary.
